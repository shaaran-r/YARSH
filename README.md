ðŸŒ± Soil Classification with Deep Learning
ðŸ“Œ Overview
Soil plays a foundational role in agriculture and the environment. Healthy soils support plant growth and food production, making accurate and efficient soil classification valuable for:

Crop management

Land use planning

Environmental assessment

Geology and engineering applications

This project applies computer vision and deep learning techniques to classify soil images into one of four types or identify non-soil images. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we train a model to automatically predict soil types based on image features like color, texture, and patterns.

ðŸ§  Project Objective
Build a robust model to:

Automatically classify soil images into one of the four types:

Alluvial soil

Black Soil

Clay soil

Red soil

Or determine if an image is not soil at all

Ensure high accuracy through balanced datasets, augmentations, and reproducible code
