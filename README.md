# 🌱 Soil Classification with Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview

Soil plays a **foundational role in agriculture and the environment**. Healthy soils support plant growth and food production, making accurate and efficient soil classification valuable for:

- Crop management  
- Land use planning  
- Environmental assessment  
- Geology and engineering applications

This project applies **computer vision** and **deep learning** techniques to classify soil images into one of four types or identify non-soil images. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we train a model to automatically predict soil types based on image features like **color**, **texture**, and **patterns**.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

Build a robust model to:
- Automatically classify soil images into one of the four types:
  - **Alluvial soil**
  - **Black Soil**
  - **Clay soil**
  - **Red soil**
- Or determine if an image is **not soil at all**
- Ensure high accuracy through balanced datasets, augmentations, and reproducible code

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes:
- A CSV file: `train_labels.csv` with `image_id` and `soil_type` columns
- A folder of soil images with varying size and resolution

Each image has a **ground-truth label**, and input images may vary significantly in lighting and background, requiring standardization and preprocessing.

---

## 🔧 Preprocessing and Augmentation

To prepare the data:
- Resize all images to **224×224** pixels for compatibility with standard CNN architectures
- Normalize pixel values for consistency
- Apply aggressive **data augmentation** using `Albumentations` to:
  - Simulate real-world variations
  - Balance underrepresented classes
  - Improve generalization

Augmentation includes:
- Flips, crops, brightness/contrast adjustments
- Hue/Saturation shifts, gamma changes
- Noise, blur, sharpening, dropout, and more

---

## 🧪 Training Setup

The training pipeline includes:
- **Train/validation split** using stratified sampling
- **Custom PyTorch Dataset** class that combines original and augmented data
- **Efficient data loading** with `DataLoader`
- Support for multiple architectures (EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, Xception, etc.)
- Focal loss and early stopping for improved accuracy and stability

---

## 🛠️ Model Learning

- CNN learns **discriminative features** like soil texture, granularity, and color tones
- Image augmentations improve robustness against background and lighting changes
- Validation ensures proper tuning of hyperparameters
